class_name BADMatchHandler
extends Node
## Attach this script to a Node in your game scene, to aid in spawning players
## based off network events. To be used along side a [MultiplayerSpawner].
##
## The default implementation:[br]
##  - Spawns player once a connection is made, despawns after disconnected[br]
##  - Tracks a list of active players[br]
##  - Sets the name to the [i]network_id[/i] of the peer[br][br]
## 
## If you want to use most of the default functionality, it's likely at a 
## minimum, you'll want to override the [method ready_player] function to set 
## custom player properties (player name, spawn location, etc) for when your 
## player spawns in game. Otherwise, override any mix of functions.
